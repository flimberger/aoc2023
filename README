			Advent of Code 2023



Requirements:

- Erlang
- BSD make


Setup:

Each day is implemented in a directory containing an Erlang module which
provides four functions:

- puzzle1/0 - runs the solution for the first task on the input file
  (usually input.txt)
- test1/0 - runs the solution on the provided test data for the first
  task (usually example1.txt)
- puzzle2/0 - runs the solution for the second task on the input file
  (usually input.txt)
- test2/0 - runs the solution on the provided test data for the second
  task (usually example1.txt)

Each directory contains a single makefile, ideally containing only two
lines:

	MOD := name

	.include "../mk/erlang.mk"
